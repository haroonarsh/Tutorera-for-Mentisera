## Local Setup

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd tutorera-backend
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm ci
```

### 3. Configure environment variables
Set the required application variables, including the Switch server-side credentials:

```bash
SWICH_CLIENT_ID=<Switch merchant client id>
SWICH_CLIENT_SECRET=<Switch merchant client secret>
SWICH_MODE=live
SWICH_AUTH_BASE_URL=<merchant-provided live OAuth base URL>
SWICH_API_BASE_URL=<merchant-provided live PayIN API base URL>
SWICH_CALLBACK_URL=https://tutorera-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/payments/swich/callback
SWICH_CALLBACK_SECRET=<merchant-provided PayIN callback signing secret>
SWICH_PWA_BASE_URL=https://payin-pwa.swichnow.com
SWICH_SUPPORTED_MARKETS=PK,AE,GB,US,SA,IN
SWICH_SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES=USD
```

Switch credentials must stay on the backend. They must never be exposed through `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, browser JavaScript, or the frontend repository. Do not add a market or currency to `SWICH_SUPPORTED_*` until Switch has confirmed merchant onboarding, settlement, payout and compliance support for that market.

Register `SWICH_CALLBACK_URL` in the Swich merchant portal. TUTORERA verifies
PayIN callbacks with `HMAC-SHA256("SWCallback:CustomerTransactionId:OrderId:Amount:Status", SWICH_CALLBACK_SECRET)` before a booking or offer is settled. The callback signing secret is separate from the OAuth client secret.

### 4. Run development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Payment Architecture

TUTORERA has one payment authority: the Render backend. Checkout creation is sent directly from the backend to Switch over its REST API. The browser receives only the hosted checkout URL. Payment completion is verified by the backend against the Switch payment-session endpoint and then checked against the booking/offer amount and currency before marketplace state is finalized.

There is no payment Cloudflare Worker and no direct database write path outside the backend payment services.
